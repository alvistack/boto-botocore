  "description": "The S3 client attempts to validate response checksums for all S3 API operations that support checksums. However, if the SDK has not implemented the specified checksum algorithm then this validation is skipped. Checksum validation behavior can be configured using the ``when_supported`` and ``when_required`` options - in code using the ``response_checksum_validation`` parameter for ``botocore.config.Config``, in the shared AWS config file using ``response_checksum_validation``, or as an env variable using ``AWS_RESPONSE_CHECKSUM_VALIDATION``."
