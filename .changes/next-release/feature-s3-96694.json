  "description": "S3 client behavior is updated to always calculate a CRC32 checksum by default for operations that support it (such as PutObject or UploadPart), or require it (such as DeleteObjects). Checksum behavior can be configured using ``when_supported`` and ``when_required`` options - in code using the ``request_checksum_calculation`` parameter for ``botocore.config.Config``, in the shared AWS config file using ``request_checksum_calculation``, or as an env variable using ``AWS_REQUEST_CHECKSUM_CALCULATION``. Note: Botocore will no longer automatically compute and populate the Content-MD5 header."
